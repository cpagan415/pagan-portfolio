# Christina Pagan Portfolio


This is a coding challenge I submitted for the UCF web development bootcamp. I used CSS and HTML to create a basic web page to showcase my projects created during the bootcamp. I used CSS flexbox to create a dynamic web page that will show case my portfolio on various screen sizes. One of my favorite features is the still background image placed.
